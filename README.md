# Territory Alignment Analysis


![](https://www.perlanet2.es/data-analyst-iberia/img/map.png)


## A)

Given a [set of data point] (https://www.perlanet2.es/data-analyst-iberia/api.getDataPoints.php) which represent all places, or Point of Sales (PoS), where our field force will be meeting each client, this exercise involves creating a proposal of 14 workable territories for each team member. The number of PoS expected in each territory is approximately 350 (2% margin above or below).

Each PoS belongs to a category that sets its importance, with Category A being the most important one. All PoS classified within A or B categories must be visited at least once.

It is important that every team member has the same opportunities in terms of high priority accounts, therefore each territory must have the same exact number of PoS A, and a reasonably similar number of Pos B, followed by the necessary amount of PoS C until expected target is reached.

## B)

Within each of the 14 defined territories, you are also expected to give a recommendation of where the team member should be based. We are looking to minimize travel time within each territory by finding the right place to start each workday, plus opportunities for recruitment are better in cities bigger than 10.000 inhabitants.

## Expectations)

The desired outcome of this exercise is a visual report or dashboard, and the target audience is Ashfield Engageâ€™s client, a major Pharmaceutical company. Therefore, our client should find in this report, at least:

## Proposed territories displayed on a map

How many PoS there are and how they are distributed within each territory, differentiated by category
Comparison of dispersion of PoS across territories
Recommendation of where team members should be based in each territory
You may use any technology or software application that you feel is appropriate to complete the task. You will be presenting your analysis via Virtual meeting in whichever format you feel is most appropriate, and you will have a maximum of 30 minutes to present your findings with an additional 15 minutes to answer any questions.

You will be scored on how well you have understood the brief, the logic of your approach, the accuracy of your output and your ability to present your findings in an appropriate way.



Note; This is a Hands on Exercise given by Ashfield Engage.
